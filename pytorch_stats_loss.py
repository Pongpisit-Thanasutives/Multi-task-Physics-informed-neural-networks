## Statistial Distances for 1D weight distributions
## Inspired by Scipy.Stats Statistial Distances for 1D
## Pytorch Version, supporting Autograd to make a valid Loss
## Supposing Inputs are Groups of Same-Length Weight Vectors
## Instead of (Points, Weight), full-length Weight Vectors are taken as Inputs
